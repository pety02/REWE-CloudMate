# Questions for the REWE-CloudMate Project

1. What content should be included in the “External Links” section (bottom-right corner on home view suggested design)? Should these be links related to the Open for Preview file, or something else? Also, should these links be clickable/openable?

2. In your design suggestion, you mentioned adding a navigation area above the file list with sorting options (e.g., Sort1 | Sort2 | … | SortN). Are my proposed sorting options—by name, size, creation date, and last update date—appropriate, or did you have something else in mind?

3. Is it acceptable to implement the search bar so that the search is triggered automatically every 3–5 seconds while the user is typing?

4. For the side navigation bar, do you have any recommendations on how to make the transition animations smoother?

5. Did I understand the side navigation behavior correctly?
- When the Home button is selected, all personal files should be displayed (files created/updated by the user as well as files shared with them).
- When the Shared button is selected, only files shared with the user should be displayed.

> **Note:**
> Most views are already designed, but not all functionality has been implemented yet 🙂
